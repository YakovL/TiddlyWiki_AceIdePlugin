# ace-Plugin.js
This plugin provides the ace.js editor for TiddlyWiki Classic.
The plugin instructions are included in the plugin documentation.
In this TiddlyWiki you can also find the babel-Plugin.js to transpile JavaScript code to es2015 style JavaScript.

Information about the ace.js editor is here: https://ace.c9.io/

Try the [ace-Plugin here](https://qbroker.github.io/ace-Plugin.js/), unfortunately you cannot save your work on GitHub, you need to install TiddlyWiki Classic yourself, to do so see the nwSaver-Plugin.js repo.

### nwSaver-Plugin.js, needed to save your work when running nw.js
